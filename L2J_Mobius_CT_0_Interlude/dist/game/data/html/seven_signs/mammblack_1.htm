May Mammon's blessing be upon you, you who controls the Seal of Gnosis! I, the Blacksmith of Mammon, have ventured deep underground in order to offer you the highest quality weapons.<br>
My skill is unmatched!<br>
I just have only one request. We Dwarves of Mammon do not accept money from the outside world. If you wish to trade, you must use <font color="LEVEL">ancient Adena</font>.<br><br>
