You're traveling, aren't you? Do you intend to actually carry all that luggage around with you? You should only take the bare necessities when you travel. Feel free to entrust your valuables to us, the Iron Gate Guild! We'll keep them safe for you!<br>
By the way, you can pick up items here that you dropped off at any of our other locations.<br>
