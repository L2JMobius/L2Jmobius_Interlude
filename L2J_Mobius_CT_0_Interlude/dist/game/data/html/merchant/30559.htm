For the glory of the everlasting flame! How are you, child of the flame?<br>
I am trader Kunai! We have items from Dwarves, so I guarantee their quality! Although we hate Dwarves, they do make good wares, and we need to sell these to compete with Elves and Humans. Just think of what you need to ensure the everlasting glory of our people, and choose your items. I guarantee you will not regret it!<br>
